Welcome to MindWork AI, where we are dedicated to advancing modern AI through innovative applications.

## About Us
At MindWork AI, our primary project is the development of **AI Studio**, a cutting-edge app designed to provide a unified chat interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). AI Studio allows users to bring their own API keys for various LLM providers, ensuring flexibility, privacy, and cost-effectiveness that other services may not offer. We believe in the power of collaboration and are always looking for passionate individuals to join us in our mission.

## About AI Studio
MindWork AI Studio is a desktop app available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides a unified chat interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). You bring your own API key for the respective LLM provider to use the models. The API keys are securely stored by the operating system.

**Key advantages:**

- **Free of charge**: The app is free to use for both personal and commercial purposes.

- **Independence**: Users are not tied to any single provider. The initial version supports OpenAI models (like GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.), with future versions planned to support other providers like Mistral and Google Gemini.

- **Unrestricted usage**: Offers unlimited usage through providers' APIs without imposed limits like those in services such as ChatGPT.

- **Cost-effective**: Pay-as-you-go can be more economical than monthly subscription services, though intensive usage may incur higher costs. Users need to monitor their expenses with the provider.

- **Privacy**: Data entered into the app is not used for training by providers since we use their APIs.

- **Flexibility**: Choose the provider and model best suited for your tasks.

- **No bloatware**: Minimal storage and resource usage, enhancing battery life and system performance.
